# QuizApp
This is my QuizApp which i wrote for a course credit. This is console App with Qt. 
The user has three opportunities to log in correctly. The login and password aren't store in database.
They are hardcoded. On first screen there is a  clock showing currently time. After an unsuccesful login attempt, the image changes to show how many failed
attempts we have. After an succesful login attempt we are redirect to second window where we can see map of Poland. Larger cities are described by clicked on buttons 
with their descriptions. There is also two buttons: one redirect to Quiz Window, and second to log out. After cliked next button. We are redirect to simple Quiz with 5 Questions about 
my home city Lublin. The last window show a simple game "like a sapper" but if we win, the image of the city is shown itself.
